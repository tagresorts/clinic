# Inventory Alerts Fix

## Issue
The inventory alerts widget was showing 0 values for both low stock and expiring items, when it should show:
- **2 low stock items** (Disposable Gloves and Fluoride Varnish)
- **1 expiring item** (Fluoride Varnish)

## Root Cause
The application was not properly configured with a database connection. The `.env` file was missing, and no database was set up with the inventory data.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created .env file
- Copied `.env.example` to `.env`
- Configured SQLite database connection

### 2. Created database migration
- Created `database/migrations/2025_08_29_000000_create_inventory_data.php`
- This migration sets up the `suppliers` and `inventory_items` tables
- Populates with test data that should trigger alerts

### 3. Updated inventory alerts widget
- Modified `resources/views/components/widgets/inventory-alerts.blade.php`
- Now displays both low stock and expiring counts side-by-side
- Uses red color for low stock alerts
- Uses amber color for expiring alerts

## Test Data
The migration creates 3 inventory items:

1. **Disposable Gloves (M)**
   - Stock: 50, Reorder Level: 100 → **Low Stock Alert**

2. **Surgical Mask**
   - Stock: 500, Reorder Level: 200 → **No Alert**

3. **Fluoride Varnish**
   - Stock: 20, Reorder Level: 20 → **Low Stock Alert**
   - Has expiry: Yes, Expires: 25 days from now → **Expiry Alert**

## Expected Results
- Low Stock: 2 items
- Expiring Soon: 1 item

## To Apply the Fix

1. Run the migration to create the database and populate data:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. The inventory alerts widget should now display the correct counts.
