User is unable to log in to the application with the credentials `admin@dentalclinic.com` and `password`.

I have tried the following steps to resolve the issue:

1.  Reset the password for `admin@dentalclinic.com` to `password123` using a temporary route and `curl`.
2.  Reset the password for `admin@dentalclinic.com` to `password123` using `php artisan tinker`.
3.  Cleared the application cache, including the route, view, and config caches.
4.  Cleared the session data.
5.  Re-seeded the database, including the roles and permissions.
6.  Cleared the permissions cache for the `spatie/laravel-permission` package.
7.  Created a new admin user to test if the issue was with the user account or the permission system.
8.  Verified that the login form has the `@csrf` directive.
9.  Verified that the `User` model uses the `HasRoles` trait.
10. Verified that the `view_dashboard` permission is assigned to the `administrator` role.

The user is still receiving a "403 User does not have the right permissions" error after successfully logging in.
