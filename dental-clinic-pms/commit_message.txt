feat: Consolidate migrations and add new features

This commit introduces a major update to the application, including:

- Consolidating all previous database migrations into a single `create_all_tables.php` migration file. This simplifies the database setup for new installations.
- Switching the database driver from SQLite to MySQL and updating the configuration.
- Adding new views and controllers for various application features like appointments, inventory, invoices, patients, reports, and treatment plans.
- General code cleanup and refactoring across the application.
